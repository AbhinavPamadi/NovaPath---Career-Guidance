## Real-time Features

### Live Updates
All collections implement real-time Firestore listeners using `onSnapshot()`:

- **Mentor profiles** update immediately when new mentors join or update profiles
- **Study buddy listings** refresh in real-time as users create/update profiles
- **Reviews** appear instantly without page refresh
- **Q&A questions and replies** sync across all connected clients
- **Connection requests** notify users immediately

### Optimistic UI Updates
- Voting actions provide immediate feedback
- Form submissions show loading states
- Error handling with retry mechanisms

## Security Implementation

### Firestore Security Rules

```javascript
// Core helper functions
function isSignedIn() {
  return request.auth != null;
}

function isOwner(resource) {
  return isSignedIn() && request.auth.uid == resource.data.authorId;
}

function isValidMentor(resource) {
  return isSignedIn() && 
         resource.data.keys().hasAll(['userId', 'name', 'email', 'bio', 'degree', 'college', 'isActive']) &&
         resource.data.userId == request.auth.uid;
}

function isValidStudyBuddy(resource) {
  return isSignedIn() && 
         resource.data.keys().hasAll(['userId', 'name', 'email', 'bio', 'examsTags', 'isActive']) &&
         resource.data.userId == request.auth.uid;
}

function isValidReview(resource) {
  return isSignedIn() && 
         resource.data.keys().hasAll(['collegeName', 'courseName', 'rating', 'content', 'authorId']) &&
         resource.data.authorId == request.auth.uid &&
         resource.data.rating >= 1 && resource.data.rating <= 5;
}
```

### Access Control Patterns

1. **Author-only Control**: Users can only edit/delete their own content
2. **Public Discovery**: Profiles and reviews are publicly readable for matching
3. **Connection Privacy**: Connection requests only visible to involved parties
4. **Community Interaction**: Voting and helpfulness ratings open to all users
5. **Validation**: Required fields and data types enforced at database level

## Technical Implementation Details

### Real-time Listeners Pattern

```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  const q = query(
    collection(db, 'mentors'),
    where('isActive', '==', true),
    orderBy('rating', 'desc'),
    limit(50)
  );
  
  const unsubscribe = onSnapshot(q, (snapshot) => {
    const mentorsList = snapshot.docs.map(doc => ({
      id: doc.id,
      ...doc.data()
    } as MentorProfile));
    setMentors(mentorsList);
    setLoading(false);
  });

  return () => unsubscribe();
}, []);
```

### Error Handling Strategy

```typescript
try {
  await createMentorProfile(profileData);
  toast({
    title: "Success!",
    description: "Profile created successfully.",
    variant: "default"
  });
} catch (error) {
  console.error('Error:', error);
  toast({
    title: "Error",
    description: "Failed to create profile. Please try again.",
    variant: "destructive"
  });
}
```

### State Management Pattern

- Local state for form data and UI interactions
- Real-time state for collection data
- Optimistic updates for user actions
- Loading and error states for better UX

## Performance Optimizations

### Database Queries
- Composite indexes for complex filtering
- Pagination with `limit()` clauses
- Client-side filtering for secondary criteria
- Efficient real-time listener setup

### Frontend Optimizations
- Loading skeletons for better perceived performance
- Debounced search inputs
- Lazy loading of heavy components
- Responsive image loading

### Caching Strategy
- Firestore offline persistence enabled
- Local state caching for frequently accessed data
- Optimistic UI updates reduce perceived latency

## Deployment Considerations

### Firestore Indexes
Required composite indexes for optimal query performance:

```
Collection: mentors
Fields: isActive (Ascending), rating (Descending)

Collection: studyBuddies  
Fields: isActive (Ascending), createdAt (Descending)

Collection: reviews
Fields: collegeName (Ascending), createdAt (Descending)

Collection: questions
Fields: tags (Array), createdAt (Descending)
```

### Environment Variables
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_project.firebaseapp.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_project.appspot.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_sender_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id
```

### Security Configuration
- Firebase Auth rules configured for secure user authentication
- Firestore rules prevent unauthorized access and data manipulation
- CORS settings properly configured for production domains

## Testing Strategy

### Component Testing
- Unit tests for individual component logic
- Integration tests for Firestore operations
- End-to-end tests for complete user workflows

### Security Testing
- Firestore rules testing with Firebase emulator
- Authentication flow validation
- Data validation and sanitization tests
